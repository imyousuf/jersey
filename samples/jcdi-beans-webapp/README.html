        <h1>JCDI Beans WebApp Sample</h1>

        <p>This example demonstrates how to develop RESTful web service with
            JCDI managed beans and an EE 6 compliant Web container.</p>

        <h2>Running the Example</h2>

        <p>If you are working with Jersey GlassFish update center module installed into your existing GlassFish
            instance,
            you will need to follow instructions at <a href="../../README.html">the module README file</a> in order to
            deploy the example.

        <p>Otherwise, you can run the example using embedded GlassFish as follows:</p>

        <p>Build and deploy the project by executing maven 2 from the project directory</p>
        <blockquote><code>mvn clean package embedded-glassfish:run</code></blockquote>
